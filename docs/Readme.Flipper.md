# Flip-42DC: A PowerShell Script for Domain Controller Management and Schema Extension

## Overview

`Flip-42DC.ps1` is a PowerShell script designed to streamline the management of domain controllers (DCs) and extend Active Directory (AD) schemas, specifically tailored for integrating MLB historical baseball data into an AD environment. Whether you're promoting a server to a DC, demoting it to a workgroup, or extending the schema with custom attributes from CSV files, `Flip-42DC` has you covered. It also includes profile backup and restore functionality to ensure a smooth transition during DC changes.

This script is part of a larger project to manage MLB historical data in AD, with a focus on players like Jeff Hamilton (`hamilje01`) from Flint, MI, and attributes like `grok` and `chatgpt`. The "42" prefix in the script name and functions reflects a personal story of discovery and meaning, inspired by the author's childhood connection to the number 42.

## Features

- **Domain Controller Management**:
  - Promote a server to a new domain controller with `Promote-42ToNewDC`.
  - Demote a domain controller to a workgroup with `Demote-42DC`.
- **Profile Management**:
  - Backup the Administrator profile before transitions with `Backup-42AdminProfile`.
  - Restore the Administrator profile after transitions with `Restore-42AdminProfile`.
- **Schema Extension**:
  - Enable schema modifications with `Enable-42SchemaModifications`.
  - Extend the AD schema from a CSV file with `Extend-42SchemaFromCSV`, supporting `String`, `Integer`, and `MultiValue` attributes.
- **Custom Attribute Creation**:
  - Create single-valued string attributes with `New-42ADString` (`oMSyntax: 20`, `attributeSyntax: 2.5.5.4`).
  - Create single-valued integer attributes with `New-42ADInteger` (`oMSyntax: 2`, `attributeSyntax: 2.5.5.9`).
  - Create multi-valued Unicode string attributes with `New-42ADMultiValueUnicode` (`oMSyntax: 64`, `attributeSyntax: 2.5.5.12`).
- **Brace-Free Display**:
  - Automatically updates type data to ensure single-valued attributes display without braces (e.g., `playerID: hamilje01` instead of `playerID: {hamilje01}`), matching the behavior of the author's previous AD forest.

## Why "42"?

The "42" prefix in the script name and functions is a tribute to the author's lifelong connection to the number 42, which began with a childhood discovery on a Levi‚Äôs zipper pull. This moment is captured in the children‚Äôs book *The Boy Who Found 42*, where a young Jim finds the number 42 and adopts it as a symbol of confidence and wonder‚Äîlater reinforced by its significance in *The Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy* as the "answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything." The "42" prefix is a personal signature, reflecting the author‚Äôs journey from a kid in Flint, MI, to an IT professional building a sophisticated AD setup for MLB historical data.

## Prerequisites

- **PowerShell Version**: 7.0 or higher (`#Requires -Version 7.0`).
- **Operating System**: Windows Server (tested on Windows Server 2019 and 2022).
- **Permissions**: Must be run with administrative privileges (Domain Admins and Schema Admins for schema modifications).
- **Modules**: Active Directory module for PowerShell (`Install-WindowsFeature -Name AD-Domain-Services -IncludeManagementTools`).
- **CSV File**: For schema extension, a `schema.csv` file generated by a schema analysis script (e.g., `Generate-Schema.ps1`) is required.

## Installation

1. **Download the Script**:
   - Clone or download `Flip-42DC.ps1` to your server.

2. **Set Execution Policy**:
   - The script sets the execution policy to `Bypass` for the current process. If you encounter issues, manually set the policy:
     ```powershell
     Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Force
     ```

3. **Prepare the CSV File (Optional)**:
   - If extending the schema, ensure you have a `schema.csv` file with the following columns:
     - `SourceFile`: The source CSV file (e.g., `Batting.csv`).
     - `AttributeName`: The AD-compliant attribute name (e.g., `playerID`).
     - `AttributeType`: `String`, `Integer`, or `MultiValue`.
     - `Description`: A description of the attribute.
     - `IsSingleValued`: `True` for single-valued, `False` for multi-valued.

   Example `schema.csv`:
   SourceFile,AttributeName,AttributeType,Description,IsSingleValued
   Batting.csv,playerID,String,2025-03-21 MLB: Attribute from Batting.csv,True
   Batting.csv,yearID,Integer,2025-03-21 MLB: Attribute from Batting.csv,True
   Batting.csv,teamID,String,2025-03-21 MLB: Attribute from Batting.csv,True
   Appearances.csv,appearances,MultiValue,2025-03-21 MLB: Hardcoded MultiValue attribute,False

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**:
- Open PowerShell as an administrator and navigate to the script‚Äôs directory:
  ```powershell
  .\Flip-42DC.ps1
  ```

2. **Select an Option**:
- The script presents a menu with the following options:
  ```
  üñ•Ô∏è  Current System Role: <Role>
  1. Promote to Domain Controller
  2. Demote to Workgroup
  3. Enable Schema Modifications
  4. Restore Administrator Profile
  5. Extend Schema from CSV
  6. Exit
  ```
- Enter a number (1-6) to select an option.

3. **Examples**:
- **Promote to DC**:
  - Choose option `1`.
  - Enter the FQDN for the new domain (e.g., `mlb.dev`).
  - The script will back up the Administrator profile, promote the server, and reboot.
- **Extend Schema**:
  - Choose option `5`.
  - Enter the path to your `schema.csv` file (e.g., `schema\schema.csv`).
  - The script will create attributes, link them to the `auxMLB` class, and update type data for brace-free display.

## Example Output

When extending the schema with the example `schema.csv` above:
üñ•Ô∏è  Current System Role: DomainController
Promote to Domain Controller
Demote to Workgroup
Enable Schema Modifications
Restore Administrator Profile
Extend Schema from CSV
Exit
Enter choice (1-6): 5
Enter the path to the schema CSV file (e.g., schema\schema.csv): schema\schema.csv
‚úÖ Schema modifications enabled.
‚úÖ Created attribute: playerID
‚úÖ Created attribute: yearID
‚úÖ Created attribute: teamID
‚úÖ Created multi-valued attribute: appearances
‚úÖ Schema cache refreshed.
‚úÖ Added playerID to auxMLB.
‚úÖ Added yearID to auxMLB.
‚úÖ Added teamID to auxMLB.
‚úÖ Added appearances to auxMLB.
‚úÖ Updated type data for brace-free display.

Test the new attributes on a user (e.g., `hamilje01`):
```powershell
Set-ADUser hamilje01 -Replace @{
    playerID = "hamilje01"
    yearID = "1988"
    teamID = "LAD"
    appearances = @("G: 111", "3B: 105")
}
Get-ADUser hamilje01 -Properties playerID,yearID,teamID,appearances,grok,chatgpt
Output:
playerID   : hamilje01
yearID     : 1988
teamID     : LAD
appearances: {G: 111, 3B: 105}
grok       : hamilje01
chatgpt    : Flint's hometown hero, World Series champ, third base rocket.
Notes
Multi-Valued Attributes: Attributes marked as MultiValue in the CSV (e.g., appearances) will display with braces, as is standard for multi-valued attributes in AD. Single-valued attributes will display without braces due to the type data update.
Schema Modifications: Ensure you have Schema Admin privileges to extend the schema. The script enables schema modifications automatically but requires the appropriate permissions.
Reboots: Promoting or demoting a DC will trigger a reboot. Ensure you save any open work before proceeding.
